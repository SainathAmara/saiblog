      <h2>This is python related post</h2>
      <p class='mainp'>Python is a dynamic language in more ways than one: Not only is it not a static language like C or C++, but it’s also constantly evolving. If you want to get up to speed on what happened in the world of Python in March 2021, then you’ve come to the right place to get your news!

March 2021 marks a notable change to the core of the Python language with the addition of structural pattern matching, which is available for testing now in the latest alpha release of Python 3.10.0.

Beyond changes to the language itself, March was a month full of exciting and historical moments for Python. The language celebrated its 30th birthday and became one of the first open-source technologies to land on another planet.</p>


<p>
  Although Python’s actual birth date is February 20, 1991, which is when version 0.9.0 was released, March is a good month to celebrate. This March is the 20th anniversary of the Python Software Foundation, which was founded on March 6, 2001.</p>
  <p >In its thirty years, Python has changed—a lot—both as a language and as an organization. The transition from Python 2 to Python 3 took a decade to complete. The organizational model for decision-making changed too: The creator of the language, Guido van Rossum, used to be at the helm, but a five-person steering council was created in 2018 to plan the future of Python.</p>

    <h2>Python 3.9 features</h2>
    <p id='sp'>Python 3.9.0
Release Date: Oct. 5, 2020

This is the stable release of Python 3.9.0
Python 3.9.0 is the newest major release of the Python programming language, and it contains many new features and optimizations.</p>

  <p>
  Python has improved drastically over the last few releases. It is now focusing on improvements to speed up the execution. Now that you know about all the new features of python 3.9, start preparing your existing code projects to support the new feature release.</p>
  <h2>Dictionary updates</h2>
  <p><img src="dict.jpg"></p>
  <p>dict1 contains the name and model of a car whereas dict2 contains the engine and curb weight.

Now we would like to merge the two dictionaries as they contain information about the same car. In Python 3.8 and earlier versions, to merge two dictionaries we use either

    <p class='mainp'>Accessing Time Zones
You can get a UTC time stamp from the datetime library like this:

>>> from datetime import datetime, timezone

>>> datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc)
datetime.datetime(2020, 9, 8, 15, 4, 15, 361413, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)
Note that the resulting time stamp is time zone aware. It has an attached time zone as specified by tzinfo. Time stamps without any time zone information are called naive.
  <p>
    The Walrus operator := is an assignment operator and is available since Python 3.8.

  It is called "walrus operator" due to its resemblance to the eyes and tusks of a walrus.

  The walrus operator assigns and returns a value at the same time.</p>
